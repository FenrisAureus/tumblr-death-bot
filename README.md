# Tumblr Death Bot

## Disclaimer:

I am not a very good programmer, downloading and running the code of some random asshole on tumblr is just about the dumbest idea imagineable and I am not responsible for what happens to your machine when you do.

---

## Setup:

To run, you will need to get your own keys for the Tumblr go to [here](https://www.tumblr.com/docs/en/api/v2) for help.

Put those into `keys.json`, and set `tumblr.keys` to `"keys.json"`.  

put the name of your blog in `tumblr.post.blogName` in `kissinger.json`

You will also need to put in a wikipedia username into the YOUR_USERNAME_HERE in `kissinger.json`.

Finally, enter: `py post.py kissinger.json`.
